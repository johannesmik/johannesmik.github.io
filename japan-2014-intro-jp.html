<p>このブログに</p>
<p>In this blog entry I want to express my motivation and introduce everyone interested to my intended schedule.</p>
<div class="section" id="motivation">
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Last year, I was an exchange student at Hokkaido University. This was a unique experience I never want to miss. In my laboratory I felt heartily welcomed and my professors gave me new Denkanstoesse. I also made many new friends, the list to mention them all would be too long. I also learned a lot about the Japanese culture, and began to really enjoy the cuisine (When I came back to Germany one of the first things I did was to buy an electric rice cooker). After my 4 months stay, Sapporo felt like my 2nd hometown.</p>
<p>However, I could not help the feeling that there is so much more to see in Japan. Most of the time I was staying Hokkaido, with two short visits to Shibuya in Tokyo. But the other parts of Japan are also very interesting and each one is unique. Have a look at all the different dishes that each region serves. Or the dozens of dialects spread across the country. Regarding the people, it is said that their temper and culture differ, too! I think that because each region of Japan is so different, it's reasonable to want to visit them all.</p>
<p>Another motivation is that I want to tackle the Japanese language. I think that language is a medium that not only transports bare words, but also cultural aspects, as well as personal thoughts and feelings. By improving my speaking and listening abilities, I can get to know you all better. For this reason, I try the 'Immersion technique.' This technique sounds complicated, but it really means speaking only Japanese for the whole month. Of course, I will make errors, and when you spot them feel free to correct them.</p>
<p>I hope that my friends will help me to make this journey a success. Whether you can show me around the city, introduce me to your friends, have a coffee or cake together, or else... I'll be happy to meet all my old friends, and make many new acquaintances during my journey.</p>

<div class="section" id="schedule">
<h2>Schedule</h2>
<p>I really don't have a fixed schedule yet. As I have bought a 21-day JR Rail Ticket, I can use any train in the country. So I'm pretty free to move around the whole country.</p>
<p>However, I made a decision on which regions I want to visit. But take the numbers not too accurate, I definitely will change this schedule for a few days.</p>

<h2>Conclusive words</h2>
<p>Thanks for reading. My journey starts on Monday, I'm very excited about it :)
楽しみです。</p>
