</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Last week I registered for a six-week long testing period of Kartoffelkombinat. Today I received my first delivery.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-is-kartoffelkombinat">
<h2>What is Kartoffelkombinat?</h2>
<p>Kartoffelkombinat (KK) is a cooperative of local Munich people to grow and share regional and organic food. Every member pays a monthly fee (between 10 and 16 Euro) used to build a small farm in Eschenried, near Munich. In return, the members receive their share for the yield. In Germany, those coops are called 'Solidarische Landwirtschaft' (for solidaristic agriculture) or 'Solawi' in short. So from now on every Thursday a small crate of seasonal, regional and organic vegetables is dropped at a house in the neighborhood, which I can collect with my bicycle.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="my-intention-when-joining-kk">
<h2>My intention when joining KK</h2>
<p>A friend of mine told me about the idea of food coops, he was really fascinated about them. Unluckily, his coop didn't deliver to my neighborhood, so I had to look for another one. And I found KK! :) It looks like they have dropping stations all over Munich so it may be a good idea for you, too.</p>
<p>When finally registering, I had 3 reasons in my mind.</p>
<p>First, I wanted to integrate high quality vegetables into my diet. My current diet is mostly vegetarian. I think I got a good balance on carbs (noodles and rice), on protein (nuts, peas, soy, beans), and on fats (coconut and olive oil). Every now and then I also eat (high-quality red) meat and dairy products, mostly when I'm not at home and can't cook by myself. I also have some vegetables in my diet, but it was always the same: onions, carrots, tomatoes and champignons. I definetely had to add a greater variety of vegetables in order to keep my micronutrient levels high :)</p>
<p>I think Kartoffelkombinat excellently fulfills my wish for more diverse vegetables. Furthermore, because the food comes from the region it doesn't have to stay in chilled trucks for days (like the food from Spain or Netherlands for example) and therefore it still contains a lot of nutrients. In general KK promises vegetables of high quality, as they are organically grown and the variation (Sorte) is hand-picked.</p>
<p>Second, I didn't like the capitalistic idea of the big food chains (like REWE, ALD, or LIDL) anymore. For them food is only a ware they trade and not something you need for living (btw: the German word 'Lebensmittel' captures this idea quite good; it can be translated as 'stuff for living'). Once, I was doing my groceries and pondered about their way of selling food, and also about preprocessed food. I don't want to explain my thinking here, but personally I came to the conclusion that I don't want to keep it that way; yes, that I want to change something.</p>
<p>I think by joining KK I can get a little bit more independent from this conventional way of buying food. I still have to do some groceries at the normal companies, but the feeling that I also support a regional farm is great. They also organise  Not only I support them financially, I can also help them by preparing the food deliveries for the next day. I want to do this at least once, because its a great opportunity to get to know the farm and it's people better. All in all I think KK cares a lot more about good food than companies.</p>
<p>Third, I think KK will teach me a lot about food. I will discover new, seasonal vegetables. I will learn how to prepare them right and cook a delicious meal out of it. I will learn how to conserve the food. And I will definetely keep you updated about stuff I learned. :)</p>

<div class="section" id="my-first-delivery">
<h2>My first delivery</h2>
<p>My first delivery was quite small. The reason for that was, that nearly all households had to be delivered. If you are in vaccation, you can draw up to 4 jokers, and you don't get a delivery (and don't have to pay for it). In this week only 14 jokers were used, normally its a bit more. The same food has to be shared amongst more deliveries, and that means slightly less for all.</p>
<p>My delivery contained purple carrots, potatoes, fresh garlic, Rettich, and Mangold (todo: looks live I have to translate all that food in English haha). It was all really tasty, and I especially liked the purple-haze carrots, they had a great taste :)</p>

<p>I really like the way of KK, and I am excited for the next weeks to come.</p>
